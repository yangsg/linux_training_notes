man initctl

作用: initctl - init daemon control tool

语法: initctl [OPTION]...  COMMAND [OPTION]...  ARG...

说明:
       initctl allows a system administrator to communicate and interact with the Upstart init(8) daemon.

       When run as initctl, the first non-option argument is the COMMAND.  Global options may be specified before or after the command.

       You  may  also  create  symbolic  or  hard links to initctl named after commands.  When invoked through these links the tool will behave only as that command, with
       global and command-specific options intermixed.  The default installation supplies such links for the start, stop, restart, reload and status commands.


COMMANDS
       emit   EVENT [KEY=VALUE]...

              Requests that the named EVENT be emitted, potentially causing jobs to be started and stopped depending on their use of the start on and stop on  stanzas  in
              their configuration.

              The  optional KEY=VALUE arguments specify environment variables to be included with the event and thus exported into the environment of any jobs started and
              stopped by the event.

              The environment may also serve to specify which instance of multi-instance jobs should be started or stopped.  See start for a discussion on instances.

              There is no limitation on the event names that may be emitted with this command, you are free to invent new events and use them in your job  configurations.

              The  most  well  known event used by the default Upstart configuration is the runlevel(7) event.  This is normally emitted by the telinit(8) and shutdown(8)
              tools.
