man 5 init

作用: init - Upstart process management daemon

语法: init [OPTION]...

说明:
    init 是 system 上 all processes 的 parent, init 被 the kernel 执行 并 负责 启动 all other processes;
    init 是 all processes whose natural parents have died 且 it is responsible for reaping those when they die.
    (就是说 init 会 接收 孤儿进程 )

    被 init 管理(managed)的 Processes 被认为是 jobs 且 其 在 目录 /etc/init 下的 files 中 被定义.
    See init(5) for more details on configuring Upstart.


   Events
       init(8) is an event-based init daemon. 这意味着 that jobs 会 随 system state 的变化(changes) 自动地 被 started and stopped.
       including  as  a result of jobs starting and stopping.


       关于 更多 starting and stopping jobs 及 emitting events that will automatically start and stop jobs 的信息， 见手册 initctl(8)

       The  primary  event  is the startup(7) event, emitted when the daemon has finished loading its configuration.
       Other useful events are the starting(7), started(7), stopping(7) and stopped(7) events emitted as jobs change state.

   System V compatibility
       The Upstart init(8) daemon does not keep track of runlevels itself, instead they are implemented entirely by its userspace tools.
       The event emitted to  signify  a change of runlevel is the runlevel(7) event.  For more information see its manual page.

NOTES
       init  is not normally executed by a user process, and expects to have a process id of 1.
       If this is not the case, it will actually execute telinit(8) and pass all arguments to that.
       See that manual page for further details.
