说明:
       Lsof revision 4.87 lists on its standard output file information about files opened by processes for the following UNIX dialects:

            Apple Darwin 9 and Mac OS X 10.[567]
            FreeBSD 4.9 and 6.4 for x86-based systems
            FreeBSD 8.2, 9.0 and 10.0 for AMD64-based systems
            Linux 2.1.72 and above for x86-based systems
            Solaris 9, 10 and 11

       (See the DISTRIBUTION section of this manual page for information on how to obtain the latest lsof revision.)

       An  open  file may be a regular file, a directory, a block special file, a character special file, an executing text reference, a library, a stream or a
       network file (Internet socket, NFS file or UNIX domain socket.)  A specific file or all the files in a file system may be selected by path.

       Instead of a formatted display, lsof will produce output that can be parsed by other programs.  See the -F, option description, and the OUTPUT FOR OTHER PRO‐
       GRAMS section for more information.

       In  addition to producing a single output list, lsof will run in repeat mode.  In repeat mode it will produce output, delay, then repeat the output operation
       until stopped with an interrupt or quit signal.  See the +|-r [t[m<fmt>]] option description for more information.


OPTIONS
        --------------------------
        中文注释:
                如果没有指定任何选项, 则 lsof 会列出 所有 active processes 的所有的 open files.
        --------------------------
       In the absence of any options, lsof lists all open files belonging to all active processes.

        --------------------------
        中文注释:
                如果 any list request option 被指定, 则 other list 的 requests 必须被明确地 requested.
                (注: 就是说 指定了 任何显示 list 的选项, 如果还想同时显示其它的 list, 则还需要同时提供其它 list 所对应的选项)
        --------------------------
       If any list request option is specified, other list requests must be specifically requested - e.g., if -U is specified for the listing of UNIX socket  files,
       NFS files won't be listed unless -N is also specified; or if a user list is specified with the -u option, UNIX domain socket files, belonging to users not in
       the list, won't be listed unless the -U option is also specified.

        --------------------------
        中文注释:
                通常 被明确说明的 list options 表示 or 的关系(可理解为对选择条件进行 or 运算). 除了一些特例.
        --------------------------
       Normally list options that are specifically stated are ORed - i.e., specifying the -i option without an address and the -ufoo option produces  a  listing  of
       all network files OR files belonging to processes owned by user ``foo''.  The exceptions are:

       1) the `^' (negated) login name or user ID (UID), specified with the -u option;  (符号 `^' 此处 表示 取反 操作 或 取反运算)

       2) the `^' (negated) process ID (PID), specified with the -p option;

       3) the `^' (negated) process group ID (PGID), specified with the -g option;

       4) the `^' (negated) command, specified with the -c option;

       5) the (`^') negated TCP or UDP protocol state names, specified with the -s [p:s] option.

        --------------------------
        中文注释:
                因为它们表示排除(指 '^' 代表的取反操作), 因此它们 不会与 ORing 或 ANDing 一起应用 且 在任何 其他 selection criteria 被应用之前 起作用.
        --------------------------
       Since they represent exclusions, they are applied without ORing or ANDing and take effect before any other selection criteria are applied.

        --------------------------
        中文注释:
                -a 选项 用于 and 选择 (可理解为对 选择条件 进行 and 运算)
        --------------------------
       The  -a option may be used to AND the selections.  For example, specifying -a, -U, and -ufoo produces a listing of only UNIX socket files that belong to pro‐
       cesses owned by user ``foo''.

        --------------------------
        中文注释:
                小心: 选项 -a 会使 所有的 list selection options 进行 and 操作, 不论其 在 命令行中的 位置如何.
        --------------------------
       Caution: the -a option causes all list selection options to be ANDed; it can't be used to cause ANDing of selected pairs of selection options by  placing  it
       between them, even though its placement there is acceptable.  Wherever -a is placed, it causes the ANDing of all selection options.

        --------------------------
        中文注释:
                相同 selection set 的 Items, 如 command names, file descriptors, network addresses, process identifiers, user identifiers, zone names, security contexts,
                会 先被 joined 为 一个整体的 ORed set 并 应用, 然后 作为该 结果的 整体的 ORed set 才会去 参与 and 运算.
        --------------------------
       Items  of the same selection set - command names, file descriptors, network addresses, process identifiers, user identifiers, zone names, security contexts -
       are joined in a single ORed set and applied before the result participates in  ANDing.   Thus,  for  example,  specifying  -i@aaa.bbb,  -i@ccc.ddd,  -a,  and
       -ufff,ggg will select the listing of files that belong to either login ``fff'' OR ``ggg'' AND have network connections to either host aaa.bbb OR ccc.ddd.


        --------------------------
        中文注释:
                虽然 单个字符的选项 可以 凑在一起组合着写, 但前提是 不要 引起 歧义, 否则就应该分开 单独写.
        --------------------------
       Options  may  be  grouped  together following a single prefix -- e.g., the option set ``-a -b -C'' may be stated as -abC.  However, since values are optional
       following +|-f, -F, -g, -i, +|-L, -o, +|-r, -s, -S, -T, -x and -z.  when you have no values for them be careful that the following character isn't ambiguous.
       For  example,  -Fn  might represent the -F and -n options, or it might represent the n field identifier character following the -F option.  When ambiguity is
       possible, start a new option with a `-' character - e.g., ``-F -n''.  If the next option is a file name, follow the possibly ambiguous option with  ``--''  -
       e.g., ``-F -- name''.

        --------------------------
        中文注释:
                前缀 '+' 和 `-' 对于某些 选项有 单独特殊的 含义, 所以使用时 也要注意不要 引起 歧义.
        --------------------------
       Either  the  `+'  or  the  `-' prefix may be applied to a group of options.  Options that don't take on separate meanings for each prefix - e.g., -i - may be
       grouped under either prefix.  Thus, for example, ``+M -i'' may be stated as ``+Mi'' and the group means the same as the separate options.  Be careful of pre‐
       fix  grouping  when one or more options in the group does take on separate meanings under different prefixes - e.g., +|-M; ``-iM'' is not the same request as
       ``-i +M''.  When in doubt, use separate options with appropriate prefixes.




       --       The double minus sign option is a marker that signals the end of the keyed options.  It may be used, for example, when  the  first
                file  name  begins with a minus sign.  It may also be used when the absence of a value for the last keyed option must be signified
                by the presence of a minus sign in the following option and before the start of the file names.


       names    These are path names of specific files to list.  Symbolic links are resolved before use.  The first name may be separated from the
                preceding options with the ``--'' option.

                If  a name is the mounted-on directory of a file system or the device of the file system, lsof will list all the files open on the
                file system.  To be considered a file system, the name must match a mounted-on directory name in mount(8)  output,  or  match  the
                name  of a block device associated with a mounted-on directory name.  The +|-f option may be used to force lsof to consider a name
                a file system identifier (+f) or a simple file (-f).

                If name is a path to a directory that is not the mounted-on directory name of a file system, it is treated just as a regular  file
                is  treated - i.e., its listing is restricted to processes that have it open as a file or as a process-specific directory, such as
                the root or current working directory.  To request that lsof look for open files inside a directory name, use the +d s  and  +D  D
                options.

                If  a  name is the base name of a family of multiplexed files - e. g, AIX's /dev/pt[cs] - lsof will list all the associated multi‐
                plexed files on the device that are open - e.g., /dev/pt[cs]/1, /dev/pt[cs]/2, etc.

                If a name is a UNIX domain socket name, lsof will usually search for it by the characters of the name alone -  exactly  as  it  is
                specified  and  is  recorded  in  the  kernel socket structure.  (See the next paragraph for an exception to that rule for Linux.)
                Specifying a relative path - e.g., ./file - in place of the file's absolute path - e.g., /tmp/file - won't work because lsof  must
                match the characters you specify with what it finds in the kernel UNIX domain socket structures.

                If  a  name is a Linux UNIX domain socket name, in one case lsof is able to search for it by its device and inode number, allowing
                name to be a relative path.  The case requires that the absolute path -- i.e., one beginning with a slash ('/')  be  used  by  the
                process  that  created the socket, and hence be stored in the /proc/net/unix file; and it requires that lsof be able to obtain the
                device and node numbers of both the absolute path in /proc/net/unix and name via successful stat(2) system calls.  When those con‐
                ditions  are  met, lsof will be able to search for the UNIX domain socket when some path to it is is specified in name.  Thus, for
                example, if the path is /dev/log, and an lsof search is initiated when the working directory is /dev, then name could be ./log.

                If a name is none of the above, lsof will list any open files whose device and inode match that of the specified path name.

                If you have also specified the -b option, the only names you may safely specify are file systems for which your mount  table  sup‐
                plies alternate device numbers.  See the AVOIDING KERNEL BLOCKS and ALTERNATE DEVICE NUMBERS sections for more information.

                Multiple file names are joined in a single ORed set before participating in AND option selection.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       -u s     selects the listing of files for the user whose login names or user ID numbers are in the comma-separated set s - e.g.,  ``abe'',  or  ``548,root''.
                (There should be no spaces in the set.)

                Multiple login names or user ID numbers are joined in a single ORed set before participating in AND option selection.

                If  a  login name or user ID is preceded by a `^', it becomes a negation - i.e., files of processes owned by the login name or user ID will never be
                listed.  A negated login name or user ID selection is neither ANDed nor ORed with other selections; it is applied before all  other  selections  and
                absolutely  excludes  the  listing  of the files of the process.  For example, to direct lsof to exclude the listing of files belonging to root pro‐
                cesses, specify ``-u^root'' or ``-u^0''.

[root@dbserver ~]# grep -E 'postfix|mysql' /etc/passwd
postfix:x:89:89::/var/spool/postfix:/sbin/nologin
mysql:x:1001:1001::/home/mysql:/sbin/nologin


[root@dbserver ~]# lsof -u mysql    # 列出由用户 'mysql' 的所有进程 打开的所有 files.
[root@dbserver ~]# lsof -u postfix,mysql   # 列出有 用户 postfix 或用户 mysql 的所有进程 打开的所有 files.
[root@dbserver ~]# lsof -u 89,mysql        # 同上 (因为此处 用户 postfix 对应的 uid 就是 89)

[root@dbserver ~]# lsof -u ^root    # 列出 除 用户 root 外的所有用户的所有进程打开的 files.
[root@dbserver ~]# lsof -u ^root,^mysql # 列出 除 用户 root 和 用户 mysql  外的所有用户的所有进程打开的 files.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       -n       inhibits the conversion of network numbers to host names for network files.  Inhibiting conversion may make lsof run faster.  It is also useful when
                host name lookup is not working properly.

       -c c     selects  the  listing  of files for processes executing the command that begins with the characters of c.  Multiple commands may be specified, using
                multiple -c options.  They are joined in a single ORed set before participating in AND option selection.

                If c begins with a `^', then the following characters specify a command name whose processes are to be ignored (excluded.)

                If c begins and ends with a slash ('/'), the characters between the slashes are interpreted as a regular expression.  Shell meta-characters  in  the
                regular expression must be quoted to prevent their interpretation by the shell.  The closing slash may be followed by these modifiers:

                     b    the regular expression is a basic one.
                     i    ignore the case of letters.
                     x    the regular expression is an extended one
                          (default).

                See the lsof FAQ (The FAQ section gives its location.)  for more information on basic and extended regular expressions.

                The  simple  command specification is tested first.  If that test fails, the command regular expression is applied.  If the simple command test suc‐
                ceeds, the command regular expression test isn't made.  This may result in ``no command found for regex:'' messages when lsof's -V option is  speci‐
                fied.


[root@dbserver ~]# lsof -nc mysqld  # 列出 执行的 command 以字符串 'mysqld' 开始 的 进程 所 打开的所有 files.
[root@dbserver ~]# lsof -n  -c mysqld -c vim  # 列出 执行的 command 以字符串 'mysqld' 或 以 字符串 'vim' 开始的 进程 所打开的所有 files.

[root@dbserver ~]# lsof -nc mysqld | grep -vE '(.so(..*)?$|.frm|.MY?|.ibd|ib_logfile|ibdata|TCP)'

[root@dbserver ~]# lsof -n -c ^mysqld  # 列出 执行的 command 不是以字符串 'mysqld' 开始 的 进程 所 打开的所有 files.

[root@dbserver ~]# lsof -nc /vim'|'mysqld/   # 这里使用了正则表达式 /expression/, 默认是扩展的正则表达式, 注意 shell meta-characters 为了避免被shell解释 应该被引起来
[root@dbserver ~]# lsof -nc /'vim|mysqld'/x  # 同上

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       -p s     excludes or selects the listing of files for the processes whose optional process IDentification (PID) numbers are in the comma-separated  set  s  -
                e.g., ``123'' or ``123,^456''.  (There should be no spaces in the set.)

                PID numbers that begin with `^' (negation) represent exclusions.

                Multiple process ID numbers are joined in a single ORed set before participating in AND option selection.  However, PID exclusions are applied with‐
                out ORing or ANDing and take effect before other selection criteria are applied.

       -R       directs lsof to list the Parent Process IDentification number in the PPID column.


[root@dbserver ~]# lsof -p 38808       # 查看 PID 为 38808 的进程所 打开的 files
[root@dbserver ~]# lsof -p 38808,902   # 查看 PID 为 38808 或 902 的 进程 所打开的 files

[root@dbserver ~]# lsof -p 38808 -R | head -n 3    # 选项 -R 用于 增加显示 PPID 列
      COMMAND   PID  PPID  USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE  SIZE/OFF     NODE NAME

      mysqld  38808 38642 mysql  rtd    DIR              253,0       269       64 /

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       -i [i]   selects  the listing of files any of whose Internet address matches the address specified in i.  If no address is specified, this option selects the
                listing of all Internet and x.25 (HP-UX) network files.

                If -i4 or -i6 is specified with no following address, only files of the indicated IP version, IPv4 or IPv6, are displayed.  (An  IPv6  specification
                may  be used only if the dialects supports IPv6, as indicated by ``[46]'' and ``IPv[46]'' in lsof's -h or -?  output.)  Sequentially specifying -i4,
                followed by -i6 is the same as specifying -i, and vice-versa.  Specifying -i4, or -i6 after -i is the same as specifying -i4 or -i6 by itself.

                Multiple addresses (up to a limit of 100) may be specified with multiple -i options.  (A port number  or  service  name  range  is  counted  as  one
                address.)  They are joined in a single ORed set before participating in AND option selection.

                An Internet address is specified in the form (Items in square brackets are optional.):

                [46][protocol][@hostname|hostaddr][:service|port]

                where:
                     46 specifies the IP version, IPv4 or IPv6
                          that applies to the following address.
                          '6' may be be specified only if the UNIX
                          dialect supports IPv6.  If neither '4' nor
                          '6' is specified, the following address
                          applies to all IP versions.
                     protocol is a protocol name - TCP, UDP
                     hostname is an Internet host name.  Unless a
                          specific IP version is specified, open
                          network files associated with host names
                          of all versions will be selected.
                     hostaddr is a numeric Internet IPv4 address in
                          dot form; or an IPv6 numeric address in
                          colon form, enclosed in brackets, if the
                          UNIX dialect supports IPv6.  When an IP
                          version is selected, only its numeric
                          addresses may be specified.
                     service is an /etc/services name - e.g., smtp -
                          or a list of them.
                     port is a port number, or a list of them.


                IPv6  options  may  be  used only if the UNIX dialect supports IPv6.  To see if the dialect supports IPv6, run lsof and specify the -h or -?  (help)
                option.  If the displayed description of the -i option contains ``[46]'' and ``IPv[46]'', IPv6 is supported.

                IPv4 host names and addresses may not be specified if network file selection is limited to IPv6 with -i 6.  IPv6 host names and addresses may not be
                specified  if  network file selection is limited to IPv4 with -i 4.  When an open IPv4 network file's address is mapped in an IPv6 address, the open
                file's type will be IPv6, not IPv4, and its display will be selected by '6', not '4'.

                At least one address component - 4, 6, protocol, hostname, hostaddr, or service - must be supplied.  The `@' character, leading the host  specifica‐
                tion,  is always required; as is the `:', leading the port specification.  Specify either hostname or hostaddr.  Specify either service name list or
                port number list.  If a service name list is specified, the protocol may also need to be specified if the TCP, UDP and UDPLITE port numbers for  the
                service name are different.  Use any case - lower or upper - for protocol.

                Service  names  and  port  numbers  may be combined in a list whose entries are separated by commas and whose numeric range entries are separated by
                minus signs.  There may be no embedded spaces, and all service names must belong to the specified protocol.  Since service names may contain  embed‐
                ded minus signs, the starting entry of a range can't be a service name; it can be a port number, however.

                Here are some sample addresses:

                     -i6 - IPv6 only

       -P       inhibits the conversion of port numbers to port names for network files.  Inhibiting the conversion may make lsof run a little faster.  It  is  also
                useful when port name lookup is not working properly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       -s [p:s] s  alone directs lsof to display file size at all times.  It causes the SIZE/OFF output column title to be changed to SIZE.  If the file
                does not have a size, nothing is displayed.

                The optional -s p:s form is available only for selected dialects, and only when the -h or -?  help output lists it.

                When the optional form is available, the s may be followed by a protocol name (p), either TCP or UDP, a colon (`:')  and  a  comma-sepa‐
                rated  protocol state name list, the option causes open TCP and UDP files to be excluded if their state name(s) are in the list (s) pre‐
                ceded by a `^'; or included if their name(s) are not preceded by a `^'.

                When an inclusion list is defined, only network files with state names in the list will be present in the lsof output.  Thus, specifying
                one state name means that only network files with that lone state name will be listed.

                Case  is unimportant in the protocol or state names, but there may be no spaces and the colon (`:') separating the protocol name (p) and
                the state name list (s) is required.

                If only TCP and UDP files are to be listed, as controlled by the specified exclusions and inclusions, the -i option must  be  specified,
                too.  If only a single protocol's files are to be listed, add its name as an argument to the -i option.

                For example, to list only network files with TCP state LISTEN, use:

                     -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN

                Or, for example, to list network files with all UDP states except Idle, use:

                     -iUDP -sUDP:Idle

                State  names  vary  with UNIX dialects, so it's not possible to provide a complete list.  Some common TCP state names are: CLOSED, IDLE,
                BOUND, LISTEN, ESTABLISHED, SYN_SENT, SYN_RCDV, ESTABLISHED, CLOSE_WAIT, FIN_WAIT1, CLOSING, LAST_ACK, FIN_WAIT_2, and  TIME_WAIT.   Two
                common UDP state names are Unbound and Idle.

                See  the  lsof  FAQ  (The  FAQ  section gives its location.)  for more information on how to use protocol state exclusion and inclusion,
                including examples.

                The -o (without a following decimal digit count) and -s option (without a following protocol and state name list)  are  mutually  exclu‐
                sive;  they  can't  both  be  specified.   When neither is specified, lsof displays whatever value - size or offset - is appropriate and
                available for the type of file.

       -t       specifies  that lsof should produce terse output with process identifiers only and no header - e.g., so that the output may be piped to kill(1).  -t
                selects the -w option.


       +|-w     Enables (+) or disables (-) the suppression of warning messages.

                The lsof builder may choose to have warning messages disabled or enabled by default.  The default warning message state is indicated in  the  output
                of the -h or -?  option.  Disabling warning messages when they are already disabled or enabling them when already enabled is acceptable.

                The -t option selects the -w option.

       +D D     causes lsof to search for all open instances of directory D and all the files and directories it contains to its complete depth.

                Processing  of  the  +D option does not follow symbolic links within D unless the -x or -x  l option is also specified.  Nor does it search for open
                files on file system mount points on subdirectories of D unless the -x or -x  f option is also specified.

                Note: the authority of the user of this option limits it to searching for files that the user has permission to  examine  with  the  system  stat(2)
                function.

                Further note: lsof may process this option slowly and require a large amount of dynamic memory to do it.  This is because it must descend the entire
                directory tree, rooted at D, calling stat(2) for each file and directory, building a list of all the files it finds, and searching that list  for  a
                match with every open file.  When directory D is large, these steps can take a long time, so use this option prudently.

       +d s     causes lsof to search for all open instances of directory s and the files and directories it contains at its top  level.   +d  does  NOT

                tory D.

                Processing of the +d option does not follow symbolic links within s unless the -x or -x  l option is also specified.  Nor does it search

       +|-f [cfgGn]
                f by itself clarifies how path name arguments are to be interpreted.  When followed by c, f, g, G, or  n  in  any  combination  it
                specifies that the listing of kernel file structure information is to be enabled (`+') or inhibited (`-').

                Normally a path name argument is taken to be a file system name if it matches a mounted-on directory name reported by mount(8), or
                if it represents a block device, named in the mount output and associated with a mounted directory name.  When  +f  is  specified,
                all  path  name  arguments  will be taken to be file system names, and lsof will complain if any are not.  This can be useful, for
                example, when the file system name (mounted-on device) isn't a block device.  This happens for some CD-ROM file systems.

                When -f is specified by itself, all path name arguments will be taken to be simple files.  Thus,  for  example,  the  ``-f --  /''
                arguments direct lsof to search for open files with a `/' path name, not all open files in the `/' (root) file system.

                Be  careful  to  make  sure +f and -f are properly terminated and aren't followed by a character (e.g., of the file or file system
                name) that might be taken as a parameter.  For example, use ``--'' after +f and -f as in these examples.

                     $ lsof +f -- /file/system/name
                     $ lsof -f -- /file/name

                The listing of information from kernel file structures, requested with the +f [cfgGn] option form, is normally inhibited,  and  is
                not  available  in whole or part for some dialects - e.g., /proc-based Linux kernels below 2.6.22.  When the prefix to f is a plus
                sign (`+'), these characters request file structure information:

                     c    file structure use count (not Linux)
                     f    file structure address (not Linux)
                     g    file flag abbreviations (Linux 2.6.22 and up)
                     G    file flags in hexadecimal (Linux 2.6.22 and up)
                     n    file structure node address (not Linux)

                When the prefix is minus (`-') the same characters disable the listing of the indicated values.

                File structure addresses, use counts, flags, and node addresses may be used to detect more readily identical  files  inherited  by
                child processes and identical files in use by different processes.  Lsof column output can be sorted by output columns holding the
                values and listed to identify identical file use, or lsof field output can be parsed by an AWK or Perl post-filter script, or by a
                C program.

       +|-r [t[m<fmt>]]
                puts  lsof  in  repeat mode.  There lsof lists open files as selected by other options, delays t seconds (default fifteen), then repeats
                the listing, delaying and listing repetitively until stopped by a condition defined by the prefix to the option.

                If the prefix is a `-', repeat mode is endless.  Lsof must be terminated with an interrupt or quit signal.

                If the prefix is `+', repeat mode will end the first cycle no open files are listed - and of course when lsof is stopped with an  inter‐
                rupt  or quit signal.  When repeat mode ends because no files are listed, the process exit code will be zero if any open files were ever
                listed; one, if none were ever listed.

                Lsof marks the end of each listing: if field output is in progress (the -F, option has been specified), the default marker is `m';  oth‐
                erwise the default marker is ``========''.  The marker is followed by a NL character.

                The  optional  "m<fmt>" argument specifies a format for the marker line.  The <fmt> characters following `m' are interpreted as a format
                specification to the strftime(3) function, when both it and the localtime(3) function are available in the dialect's C library.  Consult
                the  strftime(3)  documentation  for  what may appear in its format specification.  Note that when field output is requested with the -F
                option, <fmt> cannot contain the NL format, ``%n''.  Note also that when <fmt> contains spaces  or  other  characters  that  affect  the
                shell's interpretation of arguments, <fmt> must be quoted appropriately.

                Repeat  mode reduces lsof startup overhead, so it is more efficient to use this mode than to call lsof repetitively from a shell script,
                for example.

                To use repeat mode most efficiently, accompany +|-r with specification of other lsof selection options, so the amount of  kernel  memory
                access  lsof  does  will be kept to a minimum.  Options that filter at the process level - e.g., -c, -g, -p, -u - are the most efficient
                selectors.

                Repeat mode is useful when coupled with field output (see the -F, option description) and a supervising awk or Perl script, or a C  pro‐
                gram.
