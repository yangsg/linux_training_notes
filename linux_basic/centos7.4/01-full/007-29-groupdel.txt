作用: groupdel - delete a group

语法: groupdel [options] GROUP

说明: The groupdel command modifies the system account files, deleting all entries that refer to GROUP. The named group must exist.

       You may not remove the primary group of any existing user. You must remove the user before you remove the group.
       You should manually check all file systems to ensure that no files remain owned by this group.
