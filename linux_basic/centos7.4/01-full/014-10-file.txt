man file

作用: file — determine file type

语法: file [-bchiklLNnprsvz0] [--apple] [--mime-encoding] [--mime-type] [-e testname] [-F separator] [-f namefile] [-m magicfiles] file ...
语法: file -C [-m magicfiles]


说明:
     file tests each argument in an attempt to classify it.  There are three sets of tests, performed in this order:
     filesystem tests, magic tests, and language tests.  The first test that succeeds causes the file type to be printed.

     Any file that cannot be identified as having been written in any of the character sets listed above is simply said to be “data”.
