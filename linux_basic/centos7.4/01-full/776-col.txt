man col


作用: col - filter reverse line feeds from input

语法: col [options]

说明:
       col  filters  out  reverse (and half-reverse) line feeds so the output is in the correct order with only forward and half-forward line feeds, and replaces white-space characters
       with tabs where possible.  This can be useful in processing the output of nroff(1) and tbl(1).

       col reads from standard input and writes to standard output.

[root@basic ~]# man bash | col -b > bash.mantxt

//  A reverse line feed makes the cursor go back up to the previous line. A regular line feed makes the cursor go to the next line.
//
//  Edit: ThePower is correct, these terms originate from the days of line printers, "feed" meaning to feed the paper through the printer,
//  in this case by one line, and reverse line feed moving the paper backwards by one line.
